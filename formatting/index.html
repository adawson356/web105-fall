    <p><i>Secret Daughter</i> by Shilpi Somaya Gowda is about what can happen when dual societies meet. One society is Western and one is Indian. Both cultures converge when a California girl meets a handsome guy from India in medical school. One thing leads to another, they marry, and become a childless couple living in California. She changes into a joyless woman, obsessed with being childless. Even her work as a doctor does not fill the childless void. He becomes remote and buries himself in his surgical practice. Simultaneously, in rural India, a little girl is born into a hostile world. This little girl is the <b>secret daughter</b>.</p>
    <p>The secret daughter's biological mother was one of the heroes in this story. Knowing that her previous daughter was disposed of, the Poor Mother <del>transports</del> <ins>saves</ins> her baby by putting her into an orphanage. 
    <small><i>...her arms tremble as she wraps them tightly around the baby, shielding her small body.</i> <q>Look, Kavita, you know we can’t keep this baby. We need a boy to help us in the fields, as it is, we can hardly afford one child, how can we have two? My cousin’s daughter is twenty-three and still not married, because he can’t come up with the dowry. We are not a rich family, Kavita. You know we can’t do this. </q></small>The other hero in the book is <sup>Super</sup>Grandma.  <sup>Super</sup>Grandma resides in India and is looking for a child that needs to be adopted. <sup>Super</sup>Grandma finds Secret Daughter and convinces her Indian son, and Californian daughter-in-law to adopt her. This begins the Secret Daughter's childhood.  As the child's life unfolds, the other characters in the book also live their lives. The Poor Mother, father and <small>subsequent</small> baby brother move into the city slums for a difficult existence. Californian Mom and Dad remain distant to each other despite the adoption. The Secret Daughter grows up and returns to India, after graduating from college, to work and discover her roots. Her journey back to India brings her to the slums. The Secret Daughter learns that <em>survival dictates many life decisions</em>, sometimes making baby girls expendable. The book wraps up in a positive way for the characters from California (the Secret Daughter and her adoptive family).

    <p>The book did not have an entirely resolved ending. <mark>Some people in my book club felt this lack of perfect resolution was realistic. Others would have preferred a better resolved plot.</mark> California Mom most resembles the readers in my book club, all women born in the United States, yet she was <strong> one of the most controversial characters</strong>. California Mom made daring life choices then responded to these choices in a fearful way. It took her till the end of the book to "get it". <mark>The book club discussion centered on how it took her decades to embrace the Indian culture even after marrying a man from India.</mark> Meanwhile, Californian Mom tried to alternately sabotage her own families' attempts to connect to that culture, and distanced herself from them when they did. Finally she surrendered her fears and began to live life fully, reconnecting to her family and herself. <mark>The book was well received by the book club.</mark> It had elements of romance, family and cultural interplay, and was a sobering commentary on the conditions of India's poor (especially that of young girls).

    <p>The author Shilpi Somaya Gowda wrote:</p>
     <blockquote cite="http://www.shilpigowda.com/">Having grown up in North America and visited India every few years, I was quite aware of the inequality faced by most women there, even if it didn’t materialize as much in my own educated family. One of the most disturbing manifestations is India’s gender imbalance. In most of the world, there are 105 females for every 100 males; in India, there are fewer than 93. The accepted reason for this disparity is the practice of female infanticide and abortion. It is ironic that the same advances in medical technology, such as widespread ultrasounds and safer abortions, which have led to women’s reproductive freedom in the West, have also led to their demise in the East. According to the United Nations, half a million girls in India are killed this way each year. As a result, fifty million girls and women are missing from India' s population. Fifty million.</blockquote>
