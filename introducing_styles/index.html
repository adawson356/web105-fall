    <h2 style="font-family: 'impact'; color:lightpink; text-align: center; font-size:1.2em">Ugly is as Ugly Does</h2>
    <h3 style="font-family: 'arial black'; color:white; text-align: left; font-size:.7em">Ugly is Beautiful </h3>
    <img src='mursi_lip.jpg' alt="mursi women">
    <p style="color:lavender; font-size: 1.0em; font-family: sans-serif;text-align: left;">What is wrong with ugly. Perfection is over rated and pure ugliness is hard to achieve. Mirror mirror on the wall who is the ugliest of them all? Hanging weights from your ear lobes and having foot long lobes might be considered beautiful. The Mursi women from Southern Ethiopa sport lip plated face plate decorations.</p>
    <h2 style="font-family: 'impact header'; color:lightpink; text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em">Ugly is Riveting</h2>
    <img src="komodo.jpg" alt="komodo dragon" style="display: block; margin: auto">
    <p style="color: lightgreen; font-size: 1.0 em; font-family: sans-serif;text-align: center;">If you can't take your eyes off something, or at the very least have trouble ripping away your gaze, something interesting just happened. It may leave psychic scars that are interesting in themselves. Bad dancing might be considered ugly to some and performance art to others. This Komodo Dragon is an over 300 pound venomous carnivore whom inexplicably became the inspiration for King Kong. The females can reproduce asexually through parthenogenesis, which means they don't need to attract a mate.  Just because these ancient beauties would not attract the Ford modeling agency, or a mate even, does not mean you should look away from them.</p>
    <h2 style="font-family: 'impact header'; color:lightpink; text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em">Ugly is a state of Mind</h2>
    <p style="color: lightgreen; font-size: 1.0 em; font-family: sans-serif;text-align: right;">For instance if someone was color blind or lived in an apartment with only a palette of gray this color scheme might seem refreshing! Someone who mouthed platitudes might seem ugly and fake. Richard Pryor might seem homely and profane to one audience and to another audience be beautiful because he was funny and frank instead of boring.</p>
