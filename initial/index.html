    <h2 style ="color: blue;">Why Books are so Important</h2>

    <p>This spring the Library Board commissioned a small painting of a fox holding a book at Lions Park in Fox River Grove. It was a personalized gift given to me on my last day on the board. The board asked me what my favorite book was (the favorite book is held by the fox in the painting). This stumped me because books are like a “box of chocolates”. Forrest Gump compared life to a box of chocolates because “You never know what you are going to get.” How can you pick one book above all of the others? I ended up picking Tarzan of the Apes written by Edgar Rice Burroughs in 1912 since it was read by three generations of my family. My Mother, daughter and I read the book so many times that it became the affectionate cross generational favorite. People travel abroad and physically visit places if they have the resources to do so. Since I have a library card I can visit those places too.  Sometimes I visit them in a different century, and then visit the same location again in present day. Books not only move around in time and location but they put the reader into a character’s head. Characters sometimes process unusual experiences in surprising ways.  Reading is my way to escape, travel, learn and identify with others. The Reacher series is a series that my brother Mike, my Dad and I passed around. The main character was a nomadic ex-military man who kept ending up in dangerous situations and always ended up being the hero.</p>

    <h2 style ="color: blue;">Physical Exertion</h2>

    <p>As the youngest member of my family I spent a lot of time observing my family. Enjoyment of exercise and physical work are legacies that were passed down to me. My Dad imparted a love of exercise to me. Running, walking and mowing the lawn are my hobbies. Mowing the lawn with an old fashioned reel mower is great exercise, my pedometer tells me it’s over three miles of walking. My big brother Mike was strong and strangely fearless like Reacher from the book series. He once plucked a knife away from someone trying to rob a convenience store. Another time he released a rattle snake that was trapped in his yard. Despite the nine year age difference he taught me to play chess and shared his opinions and sense of humor with me. He chopped down trees on his land and built a road which took a lot of physical endurance. Last week I chopped down a tree with an ax.  It was a good workout, but it turns out that it’s tough on the hands.</p>
    <h2 style ="color: blue;">Nature is Everything</h2>

    <p>Another thing I enjoy is nature.  Since my town Fox River Grove, as its name suggests, is near the Fox River and is heavily wooded it is a good place to walk and run.  Dog companions heighten the natural experience since they are constantly stopping, sniffing, rolling around, and running after squirrels.  Like a book, a dog really identifies a different point of view. As long as my dogs aren’t lunging at other dogs, I find that they add to the nature experience.  Plus, if a dog is getting walked, its’ owner is doing something virtuous instead of goofing off.  That’s what I tell myself anyways. Some of my most vivid memories are of being in natural environments. Nature is calming and fortifying, I am passionate about preserving nature. </p>
