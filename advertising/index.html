        <h2 style="text-align:center; font-size:1.75em; color:lightgray; font-family: eras bold, serif;">Never have another printer melt down again!</h2>
        <p><i>Have you ever had your gobbledygook come out as even less comprehensible word salad ... compliments of your computer?</i></p>
        <p><strong>Don't take that from your printer, the Hummin Printer Wizard has you covered!</strong></p>
        <h3 style="text-align:left; font-size:1.3em; color:lightgray; font-family: eras bold, serif;">Your printer will not connect to your computer.</h3>
        <p>It happens when you first try to connect to the printer, but <mark>the printer will not allow it.</mark>  Maybe the printer is not connected to the network properly.  Perhaps the wrong IP Address is being used.  Maybe Wireless Direct is on and the device it is accessing is malfunctioning.  Maybe there has been an electromagnetic pulse and your electronics are fried. <strong>Don't take that from your printer, the Hummin Printer Wizard has you covered!</strong></p>
        <!--This tagline repeats every paragraph.-->
        <h3 style="text-align:left; font-size:1.3em; color:lightgray; font-family: eras bold, serif;">My computer suddenly decides to send to a different printer of it's own volition.</h3>
        <p>Your computer may break up with your printer while you are away.  You come back to your computer, and suddenly it's not talking to your printer.  Now it's talking to another printer, or worse yet, ignoring all printers.  It's not your job to constantly reunite your printer and computer. <strong>Don't take that from your printer, the Hummin Printer Wizard has you covered!</strong></p>
        <h3 style="text-align:left; font-size:1.3em; color:lightgray; font-family: eras bold, serif;">Print Quality</h3>
        <p>Sometimes a print head nozzle in an inkjet printer is clogged. The prints are too light, too spotty, or have horizontal lines. Maybe the cheap inks in remanufactured ink cartridges look awful. Sometimes the printer claims that it's out-of-ink when it actually isn't. When your printer is sloppy or goes on strike there is only one fool proof solution.<strong>Don't take that from your printer, the Hummin Printer Wizard has you covered!</strong></p>
        <p>Paul from Minnesota remembers <q>My printer used to really get me down. Sometimes it would ruin whole print jobs, it was such a waste! That is all in the past now that I use Hummin Printer Wizard.</q></p>
        <h3 style="text-align:left; font-size:1.3em; color:lightgray; font-family: eras bold, serif;">It takes forever to print!</h3>
        <p>Patience is overrated when watching paint dry and waiting for a print job to finish. Maybe your wireless printer is too far from your printer. Sometimes there is a paper jam, but no one realizes it because they are killing time, just waiting... There is only one sure fire way to maximize print speed. Get the Hummin Computer Wizard now! <strong>Don't take that from your printer, the Hummin Printer Wizard has you covered!</strong></p>
        <p>Alice from Aurora talks about how she used to outsource print jobs:
            <blockquote style="text-align:left; font-size:1.1em; color:lightgray; font-family: eras bold, serif;">
                Instead of doing print jobs at home, I would go to SpeedQueen to do print jobs. Not only did this require travel and expense, but it would happen sometimes twice a day. Unfortunately SpeedQueen printing is next door to Dairy Queen and I gained a lot of weight. Thanks to the Hummin Printer Wizard that is all in the past.
